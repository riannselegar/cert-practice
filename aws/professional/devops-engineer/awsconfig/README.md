# AWS Config Overview

AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. It continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations. This is particularly useful for compliance auditing, security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.

## Key Features of AWS Config

1. **Resource Configuration History**:
   - AWS Config records the configuration changes of supported AWS resources over time.
   - You can view the historical configuration of a resource and understand how it has changed.

2. **Configuration Snapshots**:
   - AWS Config can generate a snapshot of the current configurations of your AWS resources.

3. **Compliance Management**:
   - AWS Config evaluates your resource configurations against rules (AWS Config Rules) to determine compliance.

4. **Change Notifications**:
   - AWS Config integrates with Amazon SNS to notify you of configuration changes.

5. **Integration with AWS Services**:
   - AWS Config integrates with services like AWS CloudTrail, AWS Organizations, and AWS Security Hub for enhanced governance and compliance.

6. **Multi-Account and Multi-Region Data Aggregation**:
   - You can aggregate AWS Config data from multiple accounts and regions into a single account for centralized management.

## Built-in Capabilities of AWS Config

1. **AWS Managed Rules**:
   - AWS Config provides a library of pre-built rules (managed rules) that you can use to evaluate your resources.
   - Examples:
     - `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited`: Ensures S3 buckets do not allow public read access.
     - `ec2-instance-no-public-ip`: Ensures EC2 instances do not have public IP addresses.
   - These rules are ready to use and require minimal configuration.

2. **Automatic Resource Discovery**:
   - AWS Config automatically discovers and tracks supported AWS resources in your account.

3. **Change Tracking**:
   - AWS Config tracks changes to resource configurations and relationships, such as security group associations or IAM role assignments.

4. **Compliance Dashboard**:
   - AWS Config provides a dashboard to view compliance status across your resources and rules.

## Customization in AWS Config

1. **Custom Config Rules**:
   - If the built-in managed rules do not meet your requirements, you can create custom rules using AWS Lambda.
   - Example:
     - A custom rule to check if EC2 instances are tagged with specific key-value pairs.
   - **Gotcha**: Writing custom rules requires knowledge of AWS Lambda and Python/Node.js for scripting.

2. **Remediation Actions**:
   - AWS Config allows you to define remediation actions for non-compliant resources.
   - Example:
     - Automatically remove public access from an S3 bucket if it violates a rule.
   - **Gotcha**: Remediation actions require you to configure Systems Manager Automation Documents (SSM Documents), which can be complex.

3. **Custom Aggregators**:
   - You can aggregate AWS Config data across multiple accounts and regions using custom configurations.
   - **Gotcha**: Ensure proper IAM permissions are in place for cross-account data aggregation.

4. **Custom Notifications**:
   - You can customize notifications for configuration changes or compliance violations using Amazon SNS.
   - **Gotcha**: Be cautious about the volume of notifications to avoid alert fatigue.

## Tricky Areas and Gotchas

1. **Resource Coverage**:
   - Not all AWS resources are supported by AWS Config. Check the [list of supported resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html) to ensure your critical resources are covered.

2. **Cost Management**:
   - AWS Config charges based on the number of configuration items recorded and the number of active rules.
   - **Gotcha**: Be mindful of the number of rules and the frequency of resource changes to avoid unexpected costs.

3. **Rule Evaluation Frequency**:
   - Managed rules are evaluated periodically or triggered by configuration changes.
   - **Gotcha**: For time-sensitive compliance checks, ensure the evaluation frequency aligns with your requirements.

4. **IAM Permissions**:
   - AWS Config requires specific IAM permissions to record resource configurations and evaluate rules.
   - **Gotcha**: Misconfigured IAM roles can lead to incomplete data or rule evaluation failures.

5. **Multi-Account Setup**:
   - Aggregating data across multiple accounts requires AWS Organizations and proper permissions.
   - **Gotcha**: Ensure the aggregator account has the necessary permissions to access data from member accounts.

6. **Custom Rule Complexity**:
   - Writing custom rules can be challenging, especially for complex compliance requirements.
   - **Gotcha**: Test custom rules thoroughly to avoid false positives or negatives.

7. **Remediation Dependencies**:
   - Remediation actions depend on Systems Manager Automation Documents (SSM Documents).
   - **Gotcha**: Ensure the SSM Documents are correctly configured and tested before enabling automatic remediation.

## Steps to Use AWS Config

1. **Enable AWS Config**:
   - Go to the AWS Config console and enable the service for your account and region.
   - Choose the resources to track and specify an S3 bucket for storing configuration snapshots.

2. **Set Up Rules**:
   - Use AWS Managed Rules for common compliance checks.
   - Create custom rules using AWS Lambda for specific requirements.

3. **Monitor Compliance**:
   - Use the AWS Config dashboard to monitor compliance status and resource changes.

4. **Set Up Notifications**:
   - Configure Amazon SNS to receive notifications for configuration changes or compliance violations.

5. **Define Remediation Actions**:
   - Use Systems Manager Automation Documents to define remediation actions for non-compliant resources.
